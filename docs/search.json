Download it from here.\nClick “Citrix Workspace app [XXXX] for Windows”. Install it and do not click any optional boxes like “Add account”. \nAdd https://sso.megamation.com/ to your “Chrome Settings - Cookies - Always clear cookies when windows are closed”. See the very bottom of this screenshot:\n\nThe need for clearing cookies is we need a new session id each time we start Chrome.\n\nUsing the link in 4., access Citrix via a private browser (e.g. Chrome’s Incognito Mode) to avoid a cache. You will see this web page.\n\nThe need for the incognito window has to do with CCS encryption where if we get kicked out of UofG’s Central login we cannot log back into Megamation.\n\nClick D in this part of the webpage:\n\nThis application will open on your taskbar with the icon \nNB Never click the outermost X (very top right) on the following screenshot of a Citrix instance; it severs connection to the database and IT will need to reinstate the connection."
