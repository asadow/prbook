## Access Instructions

1.  IT will create your Megamation account.

2.  **Citrix Workspace App** needs to be downloaded. It is a secure interface to the webpage where Megamation lives. Download it from [here](https://www.citrix.com/downloads/workspace-app/).

3.  Click "Citrix Workspace app \[XXXX\] for Windows". Install it and do **not** click any optional boxes like "Add account". ![](images/paste-9F18CD79.png)

4.  Add https://sso.megamation.com/ to your "Chrome Settings - Cookies - Always clear cookies when windows are closed". See the very bottom of this screenshot:![](images/paste-B97C5881.png)

[The need for clearing cookies is we need a new session id each time we start Chrome.]{.aside}

5.  Using the link in 4., access Citrix via a private browser (e.g. Chrome's Incognito Mode) to avoid a cache. You will see this [web page](https://sso.megamation.com/uog).

[The need for the incognito window has to do with CCS encryption where if we get kicked out of UofG's Central login we cannot log back into Megamation.]{.aside}

6.  Click *D* in this part of the webpage:

8.  NB **Never** click the outermost X (very top right) on the following screenshot of a Citrix instance; it severs connection to the database and IT will need to reinstate the connection.

Click "Export" at bottom right. Click off "Auto-format Spreadsheet" if you want a faster export.

![](images/paste-CA669F29.png) [NB for big files: the Excel file that pops up after clicking Export" may not be ready and may still be populating. This is why we use "Automated Report" (second image under **Define the export**) for big exports. "Automated Report" will do automatically do the export in the morning and save it. If not using "Automated Report", make sure to save the Excel pop-up file before closing.]{.aside}

Click "Utilities" and the following.
