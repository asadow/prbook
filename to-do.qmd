# To-Do

- Ask for a Data folder in Groups, with permissions only for oneself, and subfolders can have more permissions

transApp:

- Add error messages, and req()
- Add a "render" button to transApp to avoid unnecessary computations due to "full reactivity"
- Use an employee master as the data for UI
- Use pre-computed occasions for all codes in prdata::occasions
- Consider: do you really need reactable?
- Incorporate viridis palette

Not a priority:

- Can add time modified in code that edits Googlesheet; then reactivePoll to check this time and only invalidate when it has changed
